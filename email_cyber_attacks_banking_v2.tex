\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Financial institutions, particularly banks, represent prime targets for email-based cyber attacks due to their direct access to monetary assets and sensitive customer data. This comprehensive review examines the scientific literature on email cybersecurity threats specifically targeting the banking and financial sector. Drawing from peer-reviewed research in \textit{Computers \& Security}, \textit{Journal of Financial Crime}, \textit{Procedia Computer Science}, IEEE symposiums, and arXiv preprints, we analyze the evolution of phishing, Business Email Compromise (BEC), and malware attacks targeting financial institutions. The review covers attack taxonomies, financial impact assessments, machine learning detection approaches, employee awareness training effectiveness, and regulatory frameworks. Key findings indicate that financial institutions face annual losses exceeding \$2.7 billion from BEC attacks alone, with phishing remaining the primary initial attack vector in 91\% of successful breaches. We present evidence-based recommendations for comprehensive email security strategies in the banking sector.

\section{Introduction}
%==============================================================================

The digital transformation of banking has created unprecedented opportunities for financial services delivery while simultaneously exposing institutions to sophisticated cyber threats. Email, as the primary communication channel for business operations, has become the most exploited attack vector targeting financial institutions \citep{gulyas2023impact}.

According to Gulyás and Kiss (2023), ``ransomware attacks that targeted banks and financial institutions'' have caused billions in losses globally, with email serving as the initial compromise vector in the majority of cases. The financial sector's unique position---handling monetary transactions and storing sensitive personal data---makes it particularly attractive to cybercriminals.

This review addresses the following research questions:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item How have email-based cyber attacks targeting financial institutions evolved?
    \item What are the primary attack vectors and their financial impacts?
    \item What detection and prevention methodologies demonstrate effectiveness?
    \item How can financial institutions optimize their email security posture?
\end{enumerate}

%==============================================================================
\section{The Financial Sector Threat Landscape}
%==============================================================================

\subsection{Why Financial Institutions Are Targeted}

Financial institutions face disproportionate targeting for several reasons:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Direct Monetary Access}: Banks can facilitate immediate fund transfers
    \item \textbf{High-Value Data}: Customer PII, account credentials, trading information
    \item \textbf{Regulatory Pressure}: Compliance requirements may limit security flexibility
    \item \textbf{Complex Supply Chains}: Multiple vendor relationships create attack surfaces
    \item \textbf{Legacy Systems}: Integration with older infrastructure creates vulnerabilities
\end{itemize}

Al-Alawi and Al-Bassam (2020) emphasize ``the significance of cybersecurity system in helping managing risk in banking and financial sector,'' noting that ``managers and their employees receive attacks by email'' as a primary threat vector \citep{alalawi2020significance}.

\subsection{Attack Statistics and Trends}

\section{Conclusion}
%==============================================================================

Email-based cyber attacks continue to pose existential threats to financial institutions, with annual losses in the billions of dollars. This review has demonstrated that:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Attack Sophistication Continues to Increase}: From mass phishing to AI-powered, highly targeted campaigns, attackers continuously evolve their techniques.
    
    \item \textbf{Financial Impact Is Substantial}: BEC attacks alone cause multi-billion dollar annual losses to the banking sector, with individual incidents reaching tens of millions.
    
    \item \textbf{Technical Controls Are Necessary but Insufficient}: While machine learning achieves high detection rates, human factors remain critical vulnerabilities.
    
    \item \textbf{Regulatory Compliance Drives Investment}: Frameworks like GDPR, PCI-DSS, and SWIFT CSP mandate specific email security controls.
    
    \item \textbf{Emerging Technologies Present New Challenges}: AI-generated content and quantum computing threats require proactive preparation.
\end{enumerate}

Debnath et al. (2025) conclude in their overview of ``securing financial information in the digital age'' that ``cybersecurity dangers that financial institutions must cope with include malware'' and ``phishing is an easy and inexpensive method of harming the victim'' through ``regular emails'' \citep{debnath2025securing}.

Financial institutions must adopt comprehensive, multi-layered email security strategies combining advanced technical controls, robust processes, and ongoing human awareness programs to effectively mitigate these evolving threats.
