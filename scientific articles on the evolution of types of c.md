# scientific articles on the evolution of types of cyber attacks via email

Email-based cyber attacks have evolved from basic phishing scams to sophisticated AI-enhanced social engineering exploits targeting human psychological vulnerabilities. Scientific literature highlights a progression involving increased personalization, stealth tactics, and multi-factor combinations over the past two decades. Key studies provide empirical analysis of these shifts through large datasets of malicious emails.

## Key Articles

- **Characterizing the Evolution of Psychological Factors Exploited by Malicious Emails** (arXiv:2408.11584, 2024): Analyzes 1,260 malicious emails from 2004-2024, reconciling 46 psychological factors (PFs) into 20 categories like impulsivity, trust, and authority; finds attackers increasingly exploit 9 PFs implicitly, with Inherent PFs (e.g., curiosity) most common.[^1][^2]
- **The Evolution of Cyber Threats: From Traditional Attacks to AI-Powered Challenges** (European Journal of Computer Science and Information Technology, 2025): Examines AI's role in email phishing, noting a 258% rise in machine learning use (2018-2022), with AI phishing achieving 72.4% success vs. 36.7% for traditional methods; cites 63% higher click-through rates.[^3][^1]
- **The Evolution of Phishing and Future Directions: A Review** (2025): Traces phishing from simple email scams to targeted attacks via social media and data availability; emphasizes technological drivers behind sophistication.[^4]


## Evolution Trends

Attack types shifted from mass spam/phishing in early 2000s to spear-phishing, vishing hybrids, and AI-generated content by 2020s. Psychological manipulation dominates, with correlations like cognitive miser + authority (r=0.91) showing combined exploits. Recent AI integration boosts evasion, with 87% of experts facing such attacks in 2025.[^2][^1][^3]

## Notable Findings Table

| Period | Dominant Types | Key Evolution Insight [Source] |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 2004-2013 | Basic phishing, scams | Constant PF exploitation (e.g., greed decreasing post-training awareness) [^1][^2] |
| 2014-2024 | Spear-phishing, AI phishing | 9 PFs increasingly targeted implicitly; AI success 72.4% [^1][^3] |
| 2025+ | Deepfakes, adaptive ML attacks | Mobile/email hybrids; 1,000+ daily mishing peaks [^1] |
